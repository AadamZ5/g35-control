# G35 Control

The Logictech G35 is a budget gaming headset that has a hardware microphone sidetone feature. This sidetone works fine on Windows natively. It does not work on Linux.

This is just a fun no-worry attempt at interfacing with the device via USB protocol (URB Control) and learn more Rust at the same time.

Currently it doesn't work :)
